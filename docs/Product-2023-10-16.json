A13 Bionic is the fastest chip ever in a smartphone, period. So everything feels fluid, whether you&rsquo;re launching apps, playing the latest games, or exploring new ways to work and play with augmented reality. The advanced camera system with A13 Bionic brings you Portrait mode, which artfully blurs the background to put the focus on your subject &mdash; even when you&rsquo;re taking selfies. Depth Control. A simple slider lets you blur the background as much or as little as you like &mdash; before or after you take the photo. Portrait Lighting. Choose from six studio‑quality effects, then adjust the lighting intensity to show your subject in the best possible light. Next‑generation Smart HDR knows a face when it sees one, and intelligently relights it to capture more natural-looking contours and skin tones. It also finesses highlight and shadow detail in the background. So every part of your photo looks amazing. 4K video means you&rsquo;ll see four times more detail than in 1080p HD video. And extended dynamic range adds greater detail in highlights and shadows. Touch ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone and sign in to apps instantly. You can even use it with Apple Pay to grab a coffee, get a yoga app, or shop for sneakers online. All without reaching for your credit card. Everything we make is designed to give you control over your information. All the iMessages you send are encrypted. Fingerprint data is stored on your device, never on Apple servers or in iCloud. Apple Pay doesn&rsquo;t share your credit card number. And the list goes on. iPhone SE is water resistant to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It&rsquo;s not afraid of a little coffee, tea, or soda either. And dust? No worries. The show must go on. So iPhone SE lets you watch up to 13 hours of video on a single charge.3 When you do need to power up, just set it down on a wireless charger. Or connect to an 18W fast-charge adapter to go from zero to up to 50 percent in 30 minutes. iPhone SE is made to run the latest features &mdash; and even some that haven&rsquo;t been invented yet. So you can use Dark Mode, Siri Shortcuts, and the new Photos app now. And take advantage of feature and security updates in the future.</p>", "specifications": "<p><strong>Dimensions (Overall):</strong>&nbsp;5.45 Inches (H) x 2.65 Inches (W) x .29 Inches (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;5.22 Ounces</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Product Model:</strong>&nbsp;Apple iPhone SE (2nd generation)</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Electronics Condition:</strong>&nbsp;Pre-Owned</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Electronics Features:</strong>&nbsp;Touchscreen Display, Retina Display, Wireless Charging</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Connection Type:</strong>&nbsp;Apple Lightning Connector</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Megapixels:</strong>&nbsp;12 MP</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Operating System:</strong>&nbsp;Apple iOS</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Data Storage Capacity:</strong>&nbsp;64GB</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Required, Not Included:</strong>&nbsp;Service Plan, Data Plan</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;1334 x 750</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Wireless Frequency/Band:</strong>&nbsp;3G, 4G LTE, 4G</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Video Recording Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;2160p</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Wireless Technology:</strong>&nbsp;3G, CDMA, 4G, 4G LTE, GSM</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Screen Size:</strong>&nbsp;4.7 Inches</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Processor Speed:</strong>&nbsp;2.65 GHz</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>IP rating:</strong>&nbsp;Not Specified</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Processor model:</strong>&nbsp;Hexa-core</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Contract Type:</strong>&nbsp;Unlocked</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Compatible Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp;AT&amp;T, Sprint, BOOST Mobile, Verizon, Mint Mobile, T-Mobile</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Battery:</strong>&nbsp;1 Non-Universal Lithium Ion, Required, Included</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Warranty:</strong>&nbsp;1 Year Limited Warranty.

Innovative engineering allows to stretch the display into the corners. The result is an all-screen design - our largest LCD ever in an iPhone - that still fits comfortably in your hand. A picture is worth a trillion operations. The iPhone XR camera system harnesses the unprecedented power of the Neural Engine and its ability to perform five trillion operations per second. Together with the Apple-designed ISP, it works like the world&#39;s fastest photographer&#39;s assistant to help turn your pictures into showstoppers. A whole new level of intelligence. The A12 Bionic, with our next-generation Neural Engine, delivers incredible performance. It uses real-time machine learning to transform the way you experience photos, gaming, augmented reality, and more. Security made simple. Face ID reinvented the way we unlock, log in, and pay. Some of our most sophisticated technologies - the TrueDepth camera system, the Secure Enclave, and the Neural Engine - make it the most secure facial authentication ever in a smartphone. And even faster and easier to use. Resists water and dust. The most durable front glass in a smartphone, sealed and precision-fitted with the aerospace-grade aluminum band, helps create an enclosure that&#39;s water resistant up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. iPhone XR even resists spills from Coffee, Tea, Soda, and more.</p>", "specifications": "<p><strong>Dimensions (Overall):</strong>&nbsp;5.94 Inches (H) x 2.98 Inches (W) x .33 Inches (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;6.84 Ounces</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Product Model:</strong>&nbsp;Apple iPhone XR</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Camera Features:</strong>&nbsp;Face Detection Technology, Panorama Mode, HDR Imaging, Digital Image Stabilization, Front and Rear Facing Cameras</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Electronics Condition:</strong>&nbsp;Pre-Owned</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Electronics Features:</strong>&nbsp;Mobile Hotspot, Liquid Retina Display, Built-In GPS</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Connection Type:</strong>&nbsp;Apple Lightning Connector</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Megapixels:</strong>&nbsp;12 MP</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Operating System:</strong>&nbsp;Apple iOS</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Data Storage Capacity:</strong>&nbsp;64GB</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Includes:</strong>&nbsp;Wall Charger</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Required, Not Included:</strong>&nbsp;Service Plan, Data Plan</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;1792 x 828</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Wireless Frequency/Band:</strong>&nbsp;3G, 4G LTE</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Video Recording Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;2160p</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Wireless Technology:</strong>&nbsp;3G, CDMA, 4G LTE, Bluetooth 5.0, GSM</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Screen Size:</strong>&nbsp;6.1 Inches</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Processor Speed:</strong>&nbsp;2.5 GHz</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>IP rating:</strong>&nbsp;Not Specified</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Processor model:</strong>&nbsp;Hexa-core</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Contract Type:</strong>&nbsp;Unlocked</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Compatible Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp;AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, Mint Mobile, Unlocked, T-Mobile</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Battery:</strong>&nbsp;1 Non-Universal Lithium Ion, Required, Included</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Warranty:</strong>&nbsp;1 Year Limited Warranty.
